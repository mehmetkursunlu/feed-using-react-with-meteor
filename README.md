**Meteor**<br>
**Tutorial**

In this tutorial we'll create a meteor project that uses React. We'll start off
by adding the react package. Then you'll see how you can structure your application
to use React components, and render a layout and home page using React's children
property. Finally we'll combine React rendering with routing using Iron Router.
